# Historical Map Retrieval
## Retrieve Map Using Tile Indexes

This code can retrieve tiled web map (or slippy map) from different tile servers. 
Given the boundary of desired latitude and longitude, the code will transfer into tile index and retrieve map based on the URL of tile servers.

The output will be map image (jpeg file) and its (latitude, longitude) bounding box (text file).
